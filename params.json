{"name":"Jasskass","tagline":"By Jassers - For Jassers!","body":"JassKass\r\n========\r\n## What is it?\r\nJasskass is (will be, that is...) an iOS/Android app for Jass players.\r\nIn case you aren't Swiss: Jass is a very popular, traditional Swiss card game. It stands apart from other card games in that not the Ace is the highest card in the game, but the peasant (this also reflects a typical Swiss attitude whereas the saying goes that Swiss historically don't want \"foreign judges\" :-) )\r\n\r\n## What CAN I do with it?\r\n\r\n* use it as a virtual Jass board to automatically count your points\r\n* even use the board's back side to keep track of the penalty points for each team (see [the blog][blog] for details about the rules)\r\n* see a history of past events where you have played jass (and who has won, of course)\r\n* show detailled statistics about each game (Which team scored how many points? What are the penalty points for each team? How much does each team have to pay?\r\n* show statistics over a longer period of time (Who in your team is the best overall player? Who had to pay most?)\r\n* Synchronize the status with other devices, so that you can start playing Jass using the smartphone of ANY player.\r\n\r\n## What CAN'T I do with it\r\n* Pay your dues resulting from a Jass (this would require connection with leading banks all over the world, which honestly I'm too lazy to hassle around)\r\n* Send notification emails to pending debitors (may be a feateure in an upcoming release)\r\n* buy your girlfriend flowers\r\n* search cat pictures on the internet\r\n\r\n## Where can I try it out?\r\nNowhere yet. You'll have to wait until the app is finished (or clone this repo and build what I have done so far). I'll post the links to the Apple App-Store/Google PlayStore here as soon as the app is ready to download.\r\n\r\n## Anything else?\r\nIf you like the App, drop be a line on [my blog][blog]\r\n\r\n[blog]:http://www.tiefenauer.info/?page_id=22\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
